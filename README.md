This is a tutor-student-classroom system developed using Node.js.
There are two types of users in the system

-> Tutor 
-> Student

Both the users have to register on the system.
Tutors can create, update and delete classrooms and add students to the classroom.
Tutors can share files to a classroom. Files are visible to only those students who are part of the classroom.
Files can only be created, updated, and deleted by the tutor.
Each file must consist of a name, description, created at, created by and file details field.
